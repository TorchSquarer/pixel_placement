# Pixel Placement
## Introduction
Just a repository to try an express movement of pixels using simple math and simple libraries.

## Modules used
* *Numpy* for $\pi$, $\sin$ and $\cos$.
* *Matplotlib* for plotting the projection
* *Pillow* to collect and stitch together the individual frames

## License for code
One can read the license [here](https://github.com/TorchSquarer/pixel_placement/blob/main/LICENSE). This was an exercise anyway, and I hope other can learn from the code progression here. Maybe there is something I will learn myself

## Goal
The goal of this project is to learn about projection of 2D-shapes and 3D-shapes onto a 2D-plane, and to turn the individual images into a GIF-file.

**List of Goals**
1) Make printable projection
    1) Create canvas 
    2) Print pixel onto canvas
    3) Project real coordinates onto screen coordinates
2) Save frames into a GIF
3) Make pixel move 
4) Print square
5) Make square move
    1) Closer to camera
    2) Further from camera
    3) Up
    4) Down
    5) Left
    6) Right
6) Make square rotate around
    1) its center (z-axis) and offset in 
    2) x-axis and offset in x
    3) y-axis and offset in y
7) Print cube
8) For the cube, redo transformations of
    1) translations
    2) rotation
